# School-projects
Some past projects I have worked on

I have included some of my major projects I worked on in high school

1. My grade 11 project written in java which is a summative version of the optics unit taught in grade 10 physics.
This was worked on by a friend and myself and we recieved a 100 on this project

2. My CS246 project written in C++ which is a comprehensive chess game including an AI bot that you can play against, received a 110 on this project

3. The project I made for Hack the North called Parle written in Javascript and Typescript which is supposed to help with improving public speaking utilizing NLP

4. The code used for a safe competition coded in Arduino that would control a step motor aligned to a 3D printed piece that would open and close a 3D printed death star
The step motor would activate when a laser would hit a photoresister with a certain amount of power while a button was being pressed.

5. The code used for my grade 12 final project in which we built a prototype for a solenoid operated automatic dog bowl filler. 
The code used a weight sensor to dictate when to open and close the solenoid a 100 was also recieved for this project.

6. I included a video of an early covid lockdown mini project which was an Arduino "robot" that would automatically play the google offline dino game.
